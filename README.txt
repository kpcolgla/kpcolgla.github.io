Cross-browser patch (Safari + Chrome):
- Replace your existing /assets/css/global.css with this one.
- Replace your existing /assets/js/theme.js with this one.

Key fixes:
- Removed color-mix() usage (causing Safari quirks).
- Normalized logo sizing (object-fit, explicit heights).
- Elevated card colors adjusted to ensure contrast.
- Minor spacing & hover-state fixes.
